        This year, I was on the search for my third and final co-op at Northeastern. I had 6 months free which meant I could do two internships; one winter and one summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having worked at a few medium and large sized tech companies, I wanted to try something different this year. My primary goal was to gain experience in the financial sector as it has always been an interest of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beginning in mid-August, I sent out a flurry of applications to hedge funds, prop shops, and unicorns. Slowly and surely, the Hackerrank challenges began to roll in. Much of the interview preparation I did last year managed to carry over. And so, this year, I only did two weeks or so of practice to get back into shape. My interviews themselves soon turned into practice for my other interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Phone rounds ramped up in September and onsites in October. By mid-October, I was dedicating almost all my time to recruiting, spending upwards of 40+ hours a week traveling and interviewing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having a few internships on my resume meant top companies overlooked the fact that I did not attend a "target" school. Even though I already had Apple on my resume last year, my response rate for online applications this year was almost tenfold (~40% vs ~4%). In addition to applying online, I also reached out to friends for referrals and recruiters that I had talked with in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        3/4 of my classes were on Tuesday/Friday which meant I was traveling Monday/Wednesday/Thursday. Over the course of 4 weeks, I had 2 interviews in NYC, 2 in SF, 2 in Chicago, and 1 in CT. Unluckily for me, interviews in the same city usually were not back to back. This meant many sleepless flights to catch up on school work. I was very fortunate that my professors were understanding and let me make up any missed tests and midterms.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had to schedule final round interviews tightly since Northeastern doesn't have a recruiting policy for deadlines. This meant most offers came with the standard 2 week deadline. Though the process was quite stressful, companies were in general responsive and flexible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        By the end of October, I had finished my interviews and was hearing back from companies. I was lucky in that, unlike last year, most companies got back to me around the same time. I was considering offers from Citadel, Robinhood, Quora, and Facebook for winter and DRW, Tower Research, Bridgewater, Two Sigma, Affirm, and Airbnb for summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some highlights include: exploring Chicago during my Citadel onsite, DRW bringing all the candidates to a nice dinner, ordering a lot of take-out sushi, almost missing a flight to SF, having a hotel scheduled for the wrong night in SF, and Robinhood responding in 48 minutes after my interview (by far the quickest)!
    </p>
    <p>
        Making decisions was extremely difficult as I couldn't just intern everywhere like I did last year. I ended up picking Robinhood for winter and Two Sigma for summer. For Robinhood, I was able to stop by the office during a trip to SF. I enjoyed meeting the engineers and getting a peek at the work and culture there. I chose Robinhood due to its small company size, the team I would be on (order execution), the responsibility I would be able to have, and the fact that I am a big fan of the product.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        I chose Two Sigma since being at a highly regarded hedge fund aligned perfectly with my goal to try finance. Even more, I consistently hear great praise about their engineering talent and really enjoyed the conversations with my interviewers during my onsite. Although I will not know what team I am on until later, the team matching process seemed to be very flexible in fitting with my interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        The recruiting mountain was lifted off my shoulder in early November as I signed my offer letters. I enjoyed the rest of the semester with some much-needed free time. This experience, though stressful and hectic in the moment, was extraordinarily educational and beneficial. I pushed myself and explored as many opportunities as possible. I experienced new companies and new industries. I also got much better at organizing and taking pictures of receipts.
